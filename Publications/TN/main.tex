Use the appropriate list style for all lists. An example of an unordered list:
\begin{itemize}
    \item[$\bullet$]  This is a bulleted list
    \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\circ$] This is a a level two bullet
        \begin{itemize}
        \item[$\--$]  This is a a level three bullet
    \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

An example of an ordered list:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item The first step is to decide how you want to order the list
    \item Apply the correct style
\end{enumerate}

When referring to references in the text parenthetically, use the form [X]. For example: 
\begin{quote}
As Jones and Smith have shown in [X]… 
\end{quote}
However, when a reference is referred to non-parenthetically, use the form Ref. \cite{Caxton,Eston1993,Farindon,FIPS1402,giancoli2008physics,Isley,Joslin,Maloney2016,MSU-CSE-06-2,Prives2016,Roberts1982,SP80053r4,Xiong2015}, except at the beginning of a sentence where Reference [X] is the correct form.

The default table style (borders, shading, banding, size) can be adjusted as needed. Any use of color in tables must not be used to convey information and must pass \href{https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/make-your-content-accessible-to-everyone-with-the-accessibility-checker-38059c2d-45ef-4830-9797-618f0e96f3ab}{contrast validation}. Authors should avoid merging table cells or using tables to achieve text formats. Use simple table structures, specify column header information, and repeating header rows. Superscripted letters (a, b, c, etc.) should be used for table footnotes and should appear directly below the table, restarting with ‘a’ for each table.

Figures should not rely on color alone to convey information. When choosing color follow these best practices: provide sufficient contrast, avoid \href{https://www.nature.com/articles/519291d}{rainbow scale}, and check your color palettes using \href{http://selection.datavisualization.ch/}{online tools}.

All images must have alternative text. The text should explain the image for those who use screen readers. The goal is to simplify complex images where possible. Follow instructions on how to add alt text to images in the \href{https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/using/editing-document-structure-content-tags.html#add_alternate_text_and_supplementary_information_to_tags}{PDF} or tagging figures with alttext using TagPDF.

Figure references are written as Fig. X. Figure X is used as the beginning of a sentence. Figures should appear after they are mentioned in the text. 

The alt text used for \href{https://equidox.co/blog/beyond-basic-alt-text-charts-maps-and-diagrams/}{Fig. \ref{fig:cellphone} } is “Line graph showing an upward trend in cell phone services from 2001 through 2010, with a corresponding downward trend in residential phone services over the same period.”
